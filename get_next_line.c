// Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should let
// you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
// • Your function should return the line that was read.
// If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.
// • Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when
// reading from the standard input.
// • Please note that the returned line should include the terminating \n character,
// except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.
// • Your header file get_next_line.h must at least contain the prototype of the
// get_next_line() function.
// • Add all the helper functions you need in the get_next_line_utils.c file.
